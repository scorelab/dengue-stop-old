The need to report and discover cases of Dengue patients gave birth to DengueStop - Community App.
An app using which the user can pinpoint a location on the map and tell the world about the occurence of a dengue case.
People all around the world can discover these reported cases and prevent their further spread.

Since the app's scope has been extended so that users could report any disease case,
the app is supposed to be renamed to DiseaseStop - Community App
